Diagnostics: RSSI, signal lock, ...
Begin framing messages: Rx: Detect beginning, read data, detect end, dispatch message. Tx: Package message, start Tx, shut down cleanly.
Set up SWD: Configure TRx; enable and handle interrupt; transmit SW.
	Handle irq: Disable SWD (int and or adf?), enable receiving (spi int?). Then enable spi when receive (or Tx!) is finished.
Configure multiple clients and port code if necessary; ensure sane radio configuration; enable variable power amp.
Add console output of received data so that it can be searched for test signals.
